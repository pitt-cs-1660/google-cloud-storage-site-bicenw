    <h1>A Tour to Guangxiao Road</h1>
    <p>Guangxiao Road is a small street located in Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, China. It has a length of approximately 400 meters. You will see elderly locals playing their small radios on the street, while small stalls and vendors occupy its pathways. For some, the quiet and peaceful road is like a magic box, preserving time and history with its unique historical sites and food culture in the fast-paced, high-pressure life of modern Guangzhou.</p>

    <h2>Guangxiao Temple</h2>
    <p>Guangxiao Temple is one of Guangzhou's most famous historic landmarks. The temple was originally built during the Eastern Jin Dynasty and has a history of more than 1,600 years. It is said that a monk named Huineng attained enlightenment here during the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and was recognized as the 6th Patriarch of Zen Buddhism by the Buddhist community. To commemorate this eminent monk, local residents of the city raised funds to build this temple and named it “Guangxiao Temple”. </p>

	<div class="text-content">
	<p>The temple has undergone several expansions and renovations throughout history, but its oldest structure, called “Fengfan Tower”, still retains its original appearance. The design of Fengfan Tower shows distinctive southern Chinese architectural features. Its inscriptions, stone carvings and murals also reflect a high level of craftsmanship of ancient Cantonese people. </p>

    <h2>Guangxiao Church</h2>
    <p>Not far away from the Temple is Guangxiao Church. With a flower bed in front, the main building of Guangxiao Church faces east end of the street and has three levels. Two tall bell towers sit on its north and south sides respectively. The tips of these towers are made of jade glazed tile with four corners. An impressive feature of the church is its rosy stained-glass window located in the middle of the 3rd floor, with a diameter of about six meters. Under the sunlight, the window looks hazy and dreamlike.</p>

	<div class="text-content">
	<p>The construction of Guangxiao Church was funded and executed by Chinese Christians. In the early 1920s, a Pastor named Tan Woxin returned home after studying in the United States, and was hired as a professor of sociology as well as the city’s general director of the Missionary Society. Tan then began to purchase land on Guangxiao Road to build a church. Tan started the church construction project in December 1921. The construction was completed in October 1924 with a strong support of Chinese Christians in the US and Hong Kong. Visiting Guangxiao Church as a cultural relic today offers an excellent experience for understanding the history and culture of Guangzhou.</p>

	<h3>Xin-Hang-Feng Stew King</h3>
	<p>The little shop is one of the four most famous stew shops in Guangzhou with nearly 40 years of history. The most classic dish is the silky fowl stew in original coconut. The soup tastes subtly sweet with coconut aroma, while all sorts of other stewed ingredients, each with its own flavor, contribute to the unique deliciousness of the broth.</p>

	<h3>Heng-Su Vegetarian</h3>	
	<p>Of course, there are also vegetarian restaurants around the temple. Heng Su Vegetarian is a place where locals would come for a meal after finishing their daily Buddhist rituals. Popular dishes include “Kyoto meat”, “vegetarian roast goose” and “crispy shrimp cubes”. With their vivid colors and meaty texture, these vegetarian dishes look almost indistinguishable from real meat!</p>
